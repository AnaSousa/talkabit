		<p>Talk A Bit attracts people with a wide range of experience and backgrounds.
		Between 100-200 people get to socialize in one place during a Saturday evening.
		</p>
		<p>The most important thing at Talk A Bit is the opportunity to meet, talk and learn
		from one another. The attendees have time for discussions with the speakers after the 
		presentation and talk to each other. As sponsor you will have plenty of time to interact.</p>
		<p>Right now we are a bit short on supplies, so why you don't give us a help?</p>
